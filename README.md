# AI Mental Health Assistant  

## Healiya- Heal your Emotions
### Project Overview
1.  Our project is an voiced based AI Assistant for Emotional Support, it will have generative interactive capabilities that will allow for it to have a conversation with the end user. Our AI will be able to
    diagnose the end user with basic mental health conditions using text input provided by the user in specifically targeted questions, and our AI will extract the data needed from the text input and will learn
    about the user’s condition, if any for if not placebo or incorrect information preceding the auto-diagnosis.
    
3.  We know that each person is different there can be no static response order for certain diagnosis, and this is where real counselors will outshine the AI, our AI’s basic goal is to break the taboo of seeking
    mental health help in India, to provide a platform where people can be free and talk to an AI that feels almost like a real counselor.
    
5.  Our project aims to remove the stringent taboo of mental health and it’s stigma that is imbued in the Indian society, by offering a platform that enables anonymous counseling around the clock without any bias
    and will give people an incentive to open up about almost anything. This project is not aimed to be a companion or an interactive helper, but we would like for it to be something that can dig through the mud
    and find what really it is that is plaguing someone, if anything at all, and to hopefully make them feel that maybe it is worth going out and seeking help at a professional, that maybe it wasn’t normal to
    feel reclusively under the weather all the time.
